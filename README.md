# C-Disk-dictionary (vaulted)
I made this project to learn how to use the C programming language and bits manipulation.

## What I learned
I attempted to create a really large project for a C beginner, so there are a ton of mistakes in this code. I know that I should choose smaller projects specially with an unknown language.
